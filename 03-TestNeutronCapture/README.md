# TestNeutronCapture
This example tests the RMGNeutronCaptureProcess feature overwritting the standard Geant4 nCaputre process. 
This feature is supposed to accurately simulate gamma cascades after a neutron capture on certain Isotopes according to the calculations perfomed by Peter Grabmayr using the Fortran code MAURINA (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11602-y). The gadolinium gamma cascade files can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/7458654
